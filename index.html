  <h1>I'm so Sorry Backend Mentors</h1>
  <p>Dear Backend Mentors,</p>
  <p>I've been sitting here for a while now, trying to find the right words to say I'm sorry. The truth is, there's no perfect way to apologize for disrespecting you as my mentor, but I need to try anyway.</p>

        <p>First, I want to acknowledge what happened. I overstepped my boundaries with you and other mentors with the statements I made. I didn't show you or the other mentors respect you deserved. Looking back, I can see all the times I pushed too far.</p>

        <p>I've been thinking a lot about why I behaved this way. Maybe I was just trying to vent my frustration with a little chitchat Or maybe I just got too comfortable and forgot the proper relationship between mentor and mentee. None of these are excuses – just me trying to understand my own actions so I don't repeat them.</p>

        <p>What I do know is that your time and expertise are valuable. When you agreed to mentor us, you all are offering something precious – your knowledge built from years of experience, your attention, and your guidance. And instead of receiving that gift with gratitude and respect, I took it for granted.</p>

        <p>I want you to know that I've learned from this mistake. Moving forward, I promise to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Respect the mentors expertise and experience</li>
            <li>Be respectful when conversing with mentors and respect their boundaries</li>
            <li>Be mindful of your time and energy</li>
            <li>Never again mistake your kindness for an invitation to overstep boundaries</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you're willing to give me another chance, I promise you'll see a different approach from me. I'll show you through my actions, not just these words, that I understand what it means to be respectful of you as my mentor.</p>

        <p>I hope you can forgive me for my lack of respect and boundary violations. I'm committed to doing better and being the kind of mentee who honors the investment you're making in our development.</p>

        <p>Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I appreciate your consideration, regardless of what you decide going forward.</p>
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
  <p>Benjamin</p>
